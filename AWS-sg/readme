what are aws security groups
ChatGPT said:

AWS Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for your AWS resources (like EC2 instances, RDS databases, etc.). They play a critical role in securing your cloud environment.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

🔑 Key Points about Security Groups

Virtual Firewall

Security groups act at the instance level (not subnet level).

They filter traffic into (inbound) and out of (outbound) resources.

Stateful

If you allow inbound traffic on a port (say TCP 22 for SSH), the response traffic is automatically allowed back out, even if there isn’t an explicit outbound rule.

This is what makes them stateful, unlike network ACLs, which are stateless.

Rules-based

Security groups use allow rules only (you can’t explicitly deny traffic; for that, you’d use NACLs).

You can define rules based on:

Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

Port range (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH)

Source/destination (IPv4, IPv6, or another security group)

Default Behavior

By default, a new security group:

Has no inbound rules → blocks all inbound traffic.

Has one outbound rule → allows all outbound traffic.

You must explicitly add rules to allow incoming connections (like SSH or HTTP).

Attached to Resources

You attach security groups to resources like EC2 instances, Load Balancers, RDS, Lambda (VPC mode), etc.

One resource can have multiple security groups attached.

One security group can be shared across multiple resources.

📌 Example Use Cases

Allow HTTP & HTTPS access to a web server:

Inbound: TCP 80 (0.0.0.0/0), TCP 443 (0.0.0.0/0)

Allow SSH access only from your office IP:

Inbound: TCP 22 (e.g., 203.0.113.25/32)

Allow database access only from app servers:

Inbound: TCP 3306 (MySQL) from the app server’s security group

🔍 Security Groups vs. NACLs
Feature	Security Group	Network ACL (NACL)
Level	Instance-level	Subnet-level
Rules	Only allow	Allow and deny
Stateful	✅ Yes	❌ No (stateless)
Default behavior	Deny all inbound, allow all outbound	Allow all in/out

👉 In short: Security Groups protect your instances by controlling traffic at the instance level using allow-only rules and are stateful firewalls.

Do you want me to also show you a Terraform example of creating a security group for a web server (HTTP + SSH)?

Thought for 36s

got you! let’s make AWS Security Groups super clear—no jargon, lots of examples.

What is a Security Group (SG)?

Think of it like a guest list at a party for each server.
Only the people (network traffic) on the list get in; everyone else is kept out.

Where it sits: on the network card (ENI) of your resource (EC2, RDS, ALB, etc.).

Scope: lives inside one VPC (can’t be used across VPCs).

Allow-only: you can allow traffic; you can’t write “deny” rules.

Stateful: if something is allowed in, the reply is auto-allowed out (and vice-versa). You don’t need a separate return rule.

How to read a rule (the 4 parts)

Every SG rule has:

Type/Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP; “SSH” is TCP 22)

Port range (e.g., 80, 443, 22, 1024–65535)

Source (for inbound) or Destination (for outbound) – can be:

An IP/CIDR:

1.2.3.4/32 = just that one IP

10.0.1.0/24 = 256 IPs (10.0.1.0–10.0.1.255)

0.0.0.0/0 = every IPv4 (world)

::/0 = every IPv6

Another Security Group (powerful for “allow only my app servers”).

Default behavior (important!)

New SG blocks all inbound (no one can reach your instance).

New SG allows all outbound (your instance can reach the internet).

You add inbound rules for what you want to expose.

“Stateful” in plain English

If you allow inbound TCP 443, a user connects from the internet to your server. Your server replies from an ephemeral port (a random high port).
Because SGs are stateful, the reply traffic is automatically allowed—you don’t need a special outbound rule for those reply ports.

Common setups (copy these ideas)

1) Public web server (EC2)

Inbound:

TCP 80 from 0.0.0.0/0 (HTTP)

TCP 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (HTTPS)

TCP 22 from your IP only (SSH) e.g., 49.204.x.y/32

Outbound: allow all (default), or restrict if you’re strict.

2) Private database (RDS)

Inbound:

TCP 3306 (MySQL) from the WebServer SG (not from the internet)

No SSH here; you don’t log into RDS.

Outbound: usually default is fine.

3) Load Balancer + App + DB

ALB SG: Inbound 80/443 from the world → forwards to App SG

App SG: Inbound only from ALB SG (e.g., TCP 3000 or 80)

DB SG: Inbound only from App SG (e.g., 5432 Postgres)

Console: step-by-step (beginner friendly)

AWS Console → VPC → Security Groups → Create security group.

Pick the VPC, give it a name.

Add Inbound rules:

Click Add rule → Type (e.g., HTTPS), Port auto-fills, Source (CIDR or SG).

Outbound rules: leave default “All traffic” at start.

Create.

Go to your EC2 instance → Networking tab → Security → Change to attach the SG.

Best practices (keep you safe)

Never open SSH/RDP to the world (0.0.0.0/0). Use /32 (single IP), a bastion, or SSM Session Manager.

Prefer Security Group to Security Group rules over wide IP ranges.

Use IPv6 rules deliberately (remember ::/0 is the world).

Start permissive on outbound, then tighten when you know needed endpoints (e.g., only to S3 or specific APIs).

Give SGs clear names/descriptions so teammates know the intent.

Review regularly; delete unused rules/SGs.

Common gotchas

Wrong VPC: SGs are VPC-scoped. An EC2 in VPC-A can’t use an SG from VPC-B.

Multiple SGs on one instance: rules add up (union). If any SG allows it, it’s allowed.

Order doesn’t matter: SGs don’t have rule order/priority.

Security Group refs: you can only reference SGs in the same VPC.

NACL vs SG: NACLs are subnet firewalls and stateless (need both in and out rules). SGs are instance firewalls and stateful.

if you want, tell me your exact setup (public app, private DB, load balancer, etc.), and I’ll craft the exact SG rules + Terraform to match it.

custo tcp  port range

Good question 👍 — let’s break down custom TCP port range in AWS Security Groups step by step, beginner style.

🔹 What does “Custom TCP port range” mean?

When you add an inbound or outbound rule in a security group, AWS asks you:

Type → like SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, or Custom TCP

Port range → the exact port(s) you want to open

Source/Destination → who is allowed in (inbound) or out (outbound)

If you pick Custom TCP, you are telling AWS:
👉 “I want to allow traffic for a specific TCP port or a range of TCP ports that isn’t already listed (like HTTP or SSH).”

🔹 What is a Port?

A port is like a door into your computer/server.

Different services use different ports:

22 → SSH

80 → HTTP

443 → HTTPS

3306 → MySQL DB

5432 → PostgreSQL DB

8080, 3000 → custom web apps

So if you run a web app on port 3000, you must open Custom TCP → Port 3000 so users can reach it.

🔹 Single Port Example

✅ Allow your app server on port 3000 (used by Node.js, React, etc.):

Type: Custom TCP

Port Range: 3000

Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (everyone) or just your office IP

This means “allow TCP traffic on port 3000.”

🔹 Multiple Ports (Range)

Sometimes you need more than one port. Example: a game server uses ports 27015–27030.

You would set:

Type: Custom TCP

Port Range: 27015-27030

Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or restricted IPs)

That means all TCP ports between 27015 and 27030 are open.

🔹 Outbound Example

Let’s say your app needs to connect to a database on port 3306 (MySQL) in another SG.

Outbound rule:

Type: Custom TCP

Port Range: 3306

Destination: db-sg (the security group for your DB)
