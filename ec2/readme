ðŸ”¹ What is AWS EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable virtual servers (called instances) in the cloud.

 Itâ€™s one of the core services in AWS and is mainly used to run applications, host websites, process data, or even act as backend servers.

 ðŸ”¹ Key Features of EC2

On-Demand Instances â€“ Pay only for what you use, no upfront cost.

Variety of Instance Types â€“ Optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU.

Elasticity â€“ Scale up or down quickly based on traffic or workload.

Security â€“ Integrated with IAM, VPC, and security groups for access control.

Storage Options â€“ Attach EBS (Elastic Block Store), use ephemeral storage, or S3.

Custom AMIs â€“ Create your own Amazon Machine Images with pre-installed software.

Networking â€“ Assign Elastic IPs, private IPs, and configure load balancing.

Pricing Options â€“ On-demand, Reserved, Spot, and Savings Plans.

ðŸ”¹ Common EC2 Use Cases

Hosting web applications 

Running backend services or APIs

Deploying databases 

High-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning

Game servers or real-time applications

Development & testing environments

to connect to the instances u need ur .pem file which is key pair in which ur given when creating the instance

next u need use command my-key.pem ec2-user@13.126.49.49{with ur ip address} to connect use ubuntu instead of ec2-user if u given ubuntu

ðŸ”¹ Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance

Login to AWS Console

Go to EC2 Service

Click Launch Instance

Choose:

AMI (Amazon Machine Image â†’ OS like Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Windows, etc.)

Instance Type (t2.micro, t3.medium, m5.large, etc.)

Key Pair (for SSH login)

Network & Security (VPC, subnets, security groups â†’ open ports like 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP)

Launch the instance

Connect via:

ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>{in this case ubuntu}

Setup in VS Code

Install AWS CLI

Configure AWS CLI

Run:

aws configure


Enter:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region (e.g. ap-south-1 for Mumbai)

Output format (json, table, or text)

These credentials come from IAM â†’ Users â†’ Security credentials â†’ Access Keys.

3. Connect from VS Code Terminal
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>

to prevent the tfstate to be overwrite or to store when performed in github actions we created backend.tf
