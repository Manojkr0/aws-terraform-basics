1. What is AWS VPC?

VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud.
It’s a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources (EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.) in a virtual network that you define.

Think of it as your own private data center in AWS, with complete control over networking.

2. Key Features

Subnetting: Divide the VPC into multiple subnets (public/private).

Custom IP Range: Choose your own CIDR block, e.g., 10.0.0.0/16.

Route Tables: Control traffic routing between subnets and the internet.

Internet Gateway: Allow internet access for public subnets.

NAT Gateway / NAT Instance: Allow private subnets to access the internet securely.

Security Groups & NACLs: Control inbound/outbound traffic.

Peering / Transit Gateway: Connect VPCs securely.

to explain more clearly:-

1️⃣ Subnetting

A subnet is a segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can launch resources.

You can have public subnets (accessible from the internet) and private subnets (internal, no direct internet access).

Example:

VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16

Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 → hosts web servers

Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24 → hosts databases

Why:

Organizes resources logically

Provides isolation for security and management

2️⃣ Custom IP Range (CIDR Block)

When creating a VPC, you define a CIDR block (IP range).

Format: x.x.x.x/y (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)

Example:

/16 → 65,536 IP addresses

/24 → 256 IP addresses (used for a subnet)

Why:

Gives flexibility to design your network

Ensures no IP conflicts when connecting with on-prem networks

3️⃣ Route Tables

A route table determines where traffic goes.

Each subnet is associated with a route table.

Example:

Route in public subnet table:

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 → Target: Internet Gateway


Route in private subnet table:

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 → Target: NAT Gateway


Why:

Controls internal vs external traffic

Allows private subnets to communicate securely with the internet through NAT

4️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW)

IGW is a redundant gateway that allows resources in a public subnet to access the internet.

Attaches to a VPC and routes public subnet traffic to/from the internet.

Example:

EC2 in public subnet → can download updates, host websites

EC2 in private subnet → cannot directly reach internet without NAT

5️⃣ NAT Gateway / NAT Instance

NAT (Network Address Translation) lets private resources access the internet without exposing them.

NAT Gateway: Managed, highly available AWS service

NAT Instance: EC2 instance manually configured to do NAT

Example:

Private EC2 instance needs to install software updates

Traffic goes through NAT gateway in public subnet → reaches internet → response returns to private EC2

Why:

Security: private subnet remains isolated from direct internet access

6️⃣ Security Groups & NACLs

Security Groups (SG): Stateful firewall for EC2 instances

Only allows inbound/outbound traffic you specify

Changes take effect immediately

7️⃣ Peering / Transit Gateway

VPC Peering: Connects two VPCs directly (in same or different regions)

Resources can communicate privately using private IPs

Transit Gateway: Central hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-prem networks

Example:

VPC-A has application servers

VPC-B has database servers

Peering → Application servers in VPC-A can query DB in VPC-B

Why:

Secure communication between VPCs without internet exposure

Simplifies multi-VPC architecture
